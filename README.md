# TI 84 Plus Programs for Statistics

I made a collection of programs designed to assist with understanding and calculating complex mathematical concepts encountered in a statistics course. These programs are specifically tailored for the TI 84 Plus calculator.

## About the Programs

These were all developed in C, known for its efficiency and suitability for mathematical computations. 

## Installation

To install these programs on your TI 84 Plus calculator, follow these steps:

1. Download the program files from the `bin` folder located in the folder of whatever program you want to download
2. Connect your TI 84 Plus calculator to your computer.
3. Use appropriate software (like TI Connect) to transfer the files to your calculator.
4. Follow the on-device instructions to complete the installation.

## NOTE

There might be a handful of bugs and features that are unable to work. Due to my college workload, I will be unable to make any changes or fixes to the program. However I am making this repository open to anyone who wants to contribute.
